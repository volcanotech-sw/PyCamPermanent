This file contains important notes on the Raspberry Pi side of the software. It lists changes made since the last
version of the disk image was generated, so I can keep track of changes that may need to be pulled across to the pi.

Latest disk image: 2023-02-20

Changes since last disk image:
> Edited check_run.py to mount SSD if it is not mounted, rather than raising an exception as this just makes
check_run.py fail if pycam_masterpi.py hasn't been started (16/03/2023)
> Edited controllers.py to have longer timeout on check_exposure_speed when running dark_capture. This means that the
dark capture doesn't inadvertently skip over some exposure speeds because of the 1.5s default timeout (29/03/2023).
> Edited int_idx in controllers.py so that spectrometer controller doesn't keep increasing int_idx infinitely
once saturated (30/03/2023)
> Changed pycam_camera.py and pycam_spectrometer.py to use host_ip from config.txt instead of from network_comm.txt
as this should make it easy to change static IP address. host_ip only needs to be explicitly written in one place, it's
silly to have it stored multiple places (04/04/2023). NOTE, this hasn't been checked on the pis yet!
> check_disk_space.py now changed - created a new version but haven't implemented it yet as it hasn't been checked at
all. So currently it's saved as check_disk_space_new.py.
> Added a check_run.py check (controllers.py, setupclasses.py, check_run.py) that ensures the camera is in automated
capture, otherwise it won't try to kill the program. This ensures that if we are interacting with the instrument with
manual capture, etc, check_run.py won't randomly shut the system down. I haven't checked the functionality! But it
should be quite straightforward so should work. (18/05/2023)

>TODO I need to update check_disk_space.py on the disk image, it currently still uses the outdated version which checks
TODO disk space and deletes once it exceeds 100GB. This may cause issues if I keep using this. The new version deletes
TODO all data on specified days.

> TODO can I write a program that will automatically change all of the IP addresses in the files needed, so the user
> TODO doesn't need to manually change them all? The user just changes them in config.txt and the rest is done automatically
> TODO Will presumably need admin (sudo) privileges to do this.
