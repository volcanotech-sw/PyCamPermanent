# File contains all options for ports to be used for each connection. The server read this in and tries them one by one,
# It then updates the network_comm.txt file and the network_transfer.txt file on both pis so that when pycam_camera and
# pycam_spectrometer are started up they connect to the correct port
# This should prevent issues of "Socket already in use" which is an error we sometimes hit
